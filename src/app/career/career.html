                        I developed a role-based logistics and cargo insurance platform with dedicated dashboards for Admin, Basic User, and MGA roles to manage workflows efficiently. The system included robust validation mechanisms for accurate data entry and document uploads. I integrated Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) technology to automatically extract data from uploaded PDF documents and populate relevant fields, reducing manual effort by 50% and improving data accuracy. The solution also enhanced booking efficiency by 40% through automation and streamlined confirmation processes.

                        At <strong>Quess Corp,</strong> I developed a user-friendly payment and healthcare management platform that enables users to manage hospitalization and insurance-related processes efficiently. The platform supports multiple payment options and provides transaction confirmation with unique reference numbers. I implemented features for users to register disease details, upload required documents for hospitalization, and track document submission through a real-time checklist. The solution improved compliance with insurance claims and enhanced user experience through streamlined validation and workflow automation.
